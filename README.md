# watchmymcserver

a hacked together all in one graceful stopping solution for minecraft java edition servers. it attatches a file for the stdin and pipes stderr and stdout output into a log and a toml file is used to configure when to start and stop it.

**note:** this was mode for personal use. you may read the code and get it working yourself, no support will be provided.
